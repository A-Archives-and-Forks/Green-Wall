ðŸ’¡ This project is inspired by [GitHub Contributions Chart Generator](https://github-contributions.vercel.app/).

## Run this project

This project uses the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) to fetch data, so you need to use [GitHub Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) as access credentials.

First, create a [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (without any scopes will also work).

Then, create a file named `.env.local` at the top of this project, paste your token into it.

```sh
# .env.local

# The format should be: GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="[YOUR TOKEN]"

# example:
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="ghp_eQ81YcyFcwVjdJwBgUj150VPnxBf1N48Sep7"
```

After doing that, now you are ready to run `yarn dev` to develop.
